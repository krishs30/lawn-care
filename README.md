# Lawn Care
A one-page concept website built with GatsbyJS, styled with SCSS, and hosted on Netlify. The goal of this project was to help me practice building a brochure website appropriate for a small business.

## Challenges and Goals
* Design and build a website that would be appropriate for a small business
* Build a custom gallery component with lazy loaded images
* Implement a mobile responsive layout
* Integrate YouTube iframe

## Solutions
I developed the website using the static site generator GatsbyJS. I styled it using SCSS and utilized Flex and Grid to achieve a mobile responsive layout. The custom 
gallery component uses Gatsby Image and GraphQL queries to generate lazy loaded images.
